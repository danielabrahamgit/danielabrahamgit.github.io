<span style="font-size:2em;">About</span> <br><br>

I'm currently a first year Electrical Engineering PhD student at Stanford. My research interests are broadly in Medical Imaging, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning. 

Prior to starting graduate school, I graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelors in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS). During my time at Berkeley, I was fortunate to work with Professor Miki Lustig on a radar based motion sensing MRI project.
