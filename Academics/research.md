### Undergraduate Researcher - MRI Spread Spectrum Modulated Pilot Tone

In addition to working with the frequency synthesis boards, I also got the chance to impliment a new technique for Pilot Tone motion detection. This technique uses Spread Spectrum Modulation in order to spread the Pilot Tone over the entire image, leading to a noise-like image artifact. Then, using principles from GPS and spread spectrum communication systems, a motion signal can be detected robustly. After the motion signal is detected, we run the system through an interative noise artifact removal process.    

The figure below describes the block diagram of the system that we implimented:

I submitted this project to the 2022 ISMRM annual conference. It was accepted, **and the abstract can be found** [**here**](/SSMPT.pdf). 




### Undergraduate Research Assistant - MRI Beat Pilot Tone

Assisted with Suma Anand's Beat Pilot Tone project, a method of using multiple constant RF tones to detect patient motion in an MRI scanner.    

The project involved working with the ADF4351 frequency generator board, a micorcontroller, and general RF components in order to generate pure RF tones (100MHz - 3GHz), optimized for phase noise.
