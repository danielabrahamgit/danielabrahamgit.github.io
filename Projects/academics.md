## Teaching
#### EECS 16A Discussion TA (Fall 2020)
- Held office hours where students asked questions on circuit theory and linear algebra
- Ran (2x) weekly discussion sections where a group of students were lead through review material and problem sets
- Tended to student's course related question on the official course web forum (piazza)   

#### EECS 16B Content TA (Spring 2021)
- Working with a team of TAs, generated homework problem sets and exam problems for students studying circuits, signal processing, introductory machine learning, and control systems
- Ran (2x) weekly discussion sessions where groups of students are lead through interactive course material review and relevant problem sets
- Held (2x) weekly office hours where students are helped personally with course related questions
- Tended to student's course related question on the official course web forum (piazza)

## Research
#### Undergraduate Research Assitant - MRI Beat Pilot Tone

Assisted with Suma Anand's Beat Pilot Tone project, a method of using multiple constant RF tones to detect patient motion in an MRI scanner.    

The project involved working with the ADF4351 frequency generator board, a micorcontroller, and general RF components in order to generate pure RF tones (100MHz - 3GHz), optimized for phase noise.
