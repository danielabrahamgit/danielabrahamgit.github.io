### DSP Image/GIF Compression
[![DSP Image/GIF Compression](../../images/compression_diagram.jpg)]({% link Projects/DSP_Compression.md %})
<p style="text-align: center;">  
My Digital Signal Processing class (EE 123) held a final competition for an animated PNG (similar to a GIF) compression algorithm. We were tasked with keeping the final filesize below 10kB and preserving as much picture quality as possible.

This project involves using C++ to simulate many circles coliding with one another. The goal is to be able to handle as many colisions as possible in order to observe the effects of the ideal gas laws.

<p style="text-align: center;">  
Using an Arduino and other integrated circuits, magnetic levitation was sustained for a measurably infinite amount of time. This was possible thanks to the PID control algorithm.
